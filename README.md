## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Robyn.


With ten years of background in strategic work in higher ed and workforce development, I solve complex social problems by figuring out what makes people tick, and providing what they need at a precise moment in their development. My social understanding and passion for helping the underserved, combined with a thorough grasp of Javascript, the NEM (Node.JS, Express, MongoDB) stack, the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS) stack, and various other technologies, gives me a unique perspective on the pursuit of software development for the betterment of humanity. As a full-stack software engineer who demands to be constantly intellectually challenged, I thrive in high-stakes environments that strive to make the world a better place.
